# Data Mining House Energy Consumption

On October 7, 2016, the highest overall house energy consumption was at 6:00; the lowest overall house energy consumption was at 13:00. The higher house energy consumption was from 6:00 to 12:00. During this period time, the living room and barn had higher energy consumption and was quite lively. Solar generated the most substantial power between 11:00 and 13:00. The balance between overall house energy consumption and solar power generation was between 9:00 and 13:30. So for each day, focusing on decreasing energy consumption in the morning.

For 2016, the highest energy consumption was in August and September; the lowest was in July and December. The furnace 2 and 1 had the higher energy consumption before May 2016. Solar generated the most potent power in July; solar generated the weakest power in December and January. House energy consumption was more significant than solar power generation in 2016. So, each month, focus on decreasing energy consumption in summer and winter. Because overall house energy consumption was much more significant than solar power generation, we still need to save energy and not depend on solar power.

For rooms, the home office had the highest consumption, 40.96128 kW; the kitchen 38 had the lowest energy consumption, which was 0 kW. For devices, Furnace 2 had the highest energy consumption, 68.9244 kW; Microwave had the lowest energy consumption, 5.53444 kW. So, the furnace had the highest energy consumption. Microwave had the lowest energy consumption. To decrease energy consumption, we can reduce the use of furnaces.
